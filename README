NAME
    HTML::DOMbo -- convert between XML::DOM and {XML/HTML}::Element trees

SYNOPSIS
      use HTML::DOMbo;
      use HTML::TreeBuilder;
      my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder->new;
      $tree->parse_from_file('foo.html');
      my $dom_tree = $tree->to_XML_DOM;
       # Now you have an XML::DOM element tree in $dom_tree!

DESCRIPTION

    This class puts a method into HTML::Element called `to_XML_DOM',
    and puts into the class XML::DOM::Node two methods,
    `to_HTML_Element' and `to_XML_Element'.

PREREQUISITES

HTML::DOMbo suite requires Perl 5; I've only used it under Perl 5.004,
so for anything lower, you're on your own.

HTML::DOMbo requires the XML::DOM module, and the HTML-Tree
distribution.


INSTALLATION

You install HTML::DOMbo, as you would install any perl module library,
by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of HTML::DOMbo in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl


DOCUMENTATION

POD-format documentation is included in DOMbo.pm.  POD is readable
with the 'perldoc' utility.  See ChangeLog for recent changes.

HTML::DOMbo should just be sent to me at sburke@cpan.org
